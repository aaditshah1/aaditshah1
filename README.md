# Hi, I'm Aadit! 👋

## About Me
I'm a senior at the University of Maryland, College Park, studying Computer Science with a minor in Computational Finance. I’m fascinated by how computing and finance come together to create innovative solutions. In particular, I love exploring how machine learning can tackle complex financial challenges and improve decision-making. Through classes and hands‑on projects I've built a strong grounding in both disciplines, preparing me to drive technological change in the financial world.
